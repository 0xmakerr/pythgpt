![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*713-6yPuNFgW77OypZH2ZA.png)We are pleased to announce that [The Bermuda Stock Exchange](http://www.bsx.com), the preeminent fully-electronic, offshore securities exchange, is joining [Pyth Network](https://pyth.network/) to deliver institutional grade market data to the DeFi ecosystem!

The BSX has subscribed to a real-time feed of equity market data from the MIAX Pearl Equities Exchange and will publish the data to the Pyth Network in mid-July.

**Who is the Bermuda Stock Exchange?**

* The Bermuda Stock Exchange (BSX) is the world’s preeminent, fully-electronic, offshore securities exchange, offering domestic and international issuers an affordable, well-regulated listing venue.
* The BSX is recognised by a broad range of international regulatory authorities including: the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a Designated Offshore Securities Market, has Approved Stock Exchange status under Australia’s Foreign Investment Fund (FIF) taxation rules; Designated Investment Exchange status by the UK’s Financial Services Authority; Recognised Stock Exchange by the UK HM Revenue and Customs; Designated Exchange status under Canada’s Income Tax Act and is a member of America’s Central Securities Depository Association.
* The BSX expects to expand the range of data it publishes to the Pyth Network as it leverages its position as a leader in Bermuda’s capital markets and the Bermuda’s government commitment to a strong fintech regulatory foundation with the Digital Asset Business Act 2018 (DABA) creating an ideal and secure jurisdiction to foster the growth of the digital asset sector.
* The BSX is wholly owned by Miami International Holdings (MIH).

**Proven track record:**

* Global leader in the insurance linked securities (ILS) asset class and with more than 650 ILS securities listed and accounting for more than 90% of global issuances.
* Listing venue for more than 250 global debt issues with a combined nominal value of $15.77 billion at the end of 2020, up 63% from 2019.
* Listed one of the world’s first exchange-traded funds designed to track digital asset investments — the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index ETF — an open-ended investment fund that operates as a traditional ETF and tracks the Nasdaq Crypto Index.
* Full member of the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) and currently holds a seat on the WFE’s Board of Directors. The Exchange is also an affiliate member of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (I.O.S.C.O.).
