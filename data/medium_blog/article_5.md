![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*-Cc4CEUoqieuAy4_KPuddw.jpeg)We’re excited to announce that the [Pyth Price Feeds](https://pyth.network/) are now available on [Injective](https://injective.com/) (Testnet), a lightning fast blockchain optimized for building financial applications. Leading applications from the Injective ecosystem like [Helix](https://helixapp.com/), a decentralized order book exchange for crypto spot and derivatives trading, are looking to leverage Pyth data to offer yet seen products on Cosmos.

We look forward to supporting the Injective DeFi community and helping grow the broader Cosmos ecosystem by unlocking once inaccessible financial data for builders. Builders on Injective (Testnet) can now access [Pyth’s 200+ price feeds](https://pyth.network/price-feeds/) for equities, commodities, foreign exchange pairs, and cryptocurrency! Our integration with Injective is made possible thanks to [Wormhole](https://wormholenetwork.com/) and many leading Injective contributors.

*“We are thrilled to be working with Pyth to bring novel asset data into the Injective universe. Now developers create markets with high fidelity on-chain data, bringing forth a new paradigm of cross-chain data composability,”* said Injective Labs co-founder and CEO, Eric Chen.

*“Injective is one of the most successful blockchains within the Cosmos Hub to date, which is one of the many reasons why this integration is significant,”* said Mike Cahill, a director of the Pyth Data Association. *“We are excited to officially join the Cosmos ecosystem as we continue to provide developers with high-quality data and enable a revolution within DeFi.”*
