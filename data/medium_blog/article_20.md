![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*L5s36aGq9t_JWIH3ueEX7g.jpeg)We are pleased to welcome [Bybit](https://www.bybit.com), the world’s third most visited crypto exchange, to the Pyth network. Bybit will help Pyth to provide verifiable data to decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and the general public. Bybit will also offer real-time prices to over 350 spot pairs listed on the exchange as part of the company’s commitment to providing the best possible support for DeFi and the broader crypto industry.

**What is Bybit?**

* Bybit is a cryptocurrency exchange established in 2018 that offers a professional platform where crypto traders can find an ultra-fast matching engine, excellent customer service and multilingual community support.
* Available in over 160 countries and more than 16 languages supported, Bybit continues to provide robust security frameworks with 99.99% functionality for its customers.

The data feed will come from Bybit’s high-performance trading engine that pushes market data every 20 milliseconds and will be shared directly on-chain.

*“We are excited to partner with Pyth and provide the blockchain community with the accurate, transparent data it needs to develop the next generation of financial products,”* said Bill Xing, Head of Financial Products at Bybit. *“Bybit is committed to democratizing financial markets by making available market data that was previously only accessible to a limited set of institutions and users. This partnership marks an important contribution towards a more equitable and transparent future for financial services.”*

Stephen Kaminsky from Jump Crypto, one of the leading contributors to Pyth, said: *“For Pyth to become the leading oracle solution for digital assets, it requires data from all the leading crypto exchanges. The community already consists of about 15 top crypto exchanges, so seeing Bybit on this list, while not surprising, is incredibly powerful to the continued robustness and strength of the network.”*

We look forward to further joining forces with more amazing partners to build the digital data marketplace we all need — a marketplace for institutional-grade, high-fidelity financial data made accessible for any application on any blockchain.
