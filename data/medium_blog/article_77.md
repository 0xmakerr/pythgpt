========================================================

We’re still so early. Much has been built since [DeFi Summer in 2020](https://twitter.com/sbf_ftx/status/1287119237308268544), but DeFi is still immature relative to the longstanding legacy of traditional finance. [Fragmented liquidity and frictions in user experience](https://mrgn.substack.com/p/chapter-1?sd=pf) prevent mass adoption by institutions and retailers. The requisite tooling for DeFi to become truly massive is still missing. Pyth is one such tooling. In this spirit, we are excited to highlight another powerful infrastructure player working on the same mission — the **Hxro Network**.

We are joined today by the contributors of [**Hxro Network**](https://www.hxro.network/), a fully composable, on-chain derivatives primitive (#PoweredByPyth). HXRO Network is here to make DeFi capable of everything that TradFi can do ([sound familiar?](https://pyth.network/publishers)): core primitive for exchange, risk management, and settlement — at the same level as the institutional players.
