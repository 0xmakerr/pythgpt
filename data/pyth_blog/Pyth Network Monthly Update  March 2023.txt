‚ÄúSpring has returned‚Äù ‚Äî Rainer Maria RilkeIs crypto winter over yet? Because it‚Äôs starting to feel a little like spring.The garden we‚Äôve been tilling is starting to flower. You can find Pyth data blossoming everywhere: zkSync Era, Polygon‚Äôs zkEVM, Coinbase‚Äôs Base, Injective of the Cosmos Hub, and even on TradingView! New products abound too, hot off the heels of February‚Äôs Liquidity Oracle release in February. We‚Äôre excited to launch our Pyth Benchmarks, which allow anyone to query historical Pyth prices. We also took the opportunity to show the world just how fast Pyth is, launching our ARB/USD feed on the same day of the drop. Now that‚Äôs low-latency!Where is all this expansion leading to? Some Pythians are putting the pieces together. We‚Äôll release a quarterly report shortly wrapping up our accomplishments so far, and guidance on some of the long-awaited network developments in the pipeline.In the meanwhile, it was great meeting the Pythians attending the Sui and Solana Hacker Houses at Ho Chi Minh City, as well as ETH Porto! Our next stops will be at Hong Kong‚Äôs Web3 Summit and Consensus 2023 in Austin, Texas.Much like spring, Pyth is inevitable.ü§ù PartnershipsWho‚Äôs #PoweredByPyth?
