![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*YZSn0HvS5xENJet6I86a4w.jpeg)We are excited to announce that Pyth data feeds are now available on [Aurora](https://aurora.dev/), the EVM environment built on [Near](https://near.org/). We’re kicking off with [Aurigami](https://www.aurigami.finance/), the noncustodial lending, and borrowing haven, which is now #PoweredByPyth.

Thanks to the support of [Wormhole](https://wormholenetwork.com/) and many contributors of the Aurora ecosystem, we are proud to empower builders on Aurora. Any programs deployed there can permissionlessly request and directly consume any of [Pyth’s 100+ price feeds](https://pyth.network/price-feeds/) for equities, commodities, foreign exchange pairs, and cryptocurrency.

*“The integration of Pyth to Aurora is an extra step toward our ultimate goal of providing DEVs with the best building experience,”* said Anton Paisov, head of integrations at Aurora Labs. *“With over 75 data providers, we think Pyth will bring a lot of possibilities to the DEVs of our growing ecosystem — and we can’t wait to see the future creations that what will come out of this integration.”*
