First and foremost, we hope that everyone is managing through what have been exceptionally difficult weeks for all of us. Some could say this month gave rise to the most impactful developments of the Pyth network. Pyth continues to build. Our data isn‚Äôt going anywhere, except to all your favorite chains and applications.

Pyth went live on Ethereum and Optimism at the beginning of the month. Many household names from the Ethereum world started tapping into Pyth data. Pyth then made its way to Aurora, the EVM environment built on top of NEAR, and kicked off with Aurigami, the leading borrow-lending application on Aurora who is now #PoweredByPyth.

It was wonderful meeting so many Pythians on the ground at Solana Breakpoint 2022. There are recordings too for those who couldn‚Äôt catch the keynote presentation on our roadmap.

To top it all off, Pyth also managed to secure its 100th integration, a huge milestone to remember! Having launch partners in multiple L1s has been a major contributing factor for the success, and all credits go to our partners for this achievement.
