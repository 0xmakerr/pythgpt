Pyth Monthly Update  June 2023
‚ÄúJune is the time for being in the world in new ways, for throwing off the cold and dark spots of life.‚Äù ‚Äî Joan ChittisterSummertime! A time of relaxation for some, and a time for continued dedication for the Pyth Network contributors and our vibrant ecosystem of Web3 leaders and capital markets pioneers.Let‚Äôs talk scalability. This month alone, Pyth brought its full catalog of 250+ price feeds to four new blockchains: Gnosis, Fantom, Osmosis, and Mantle. This rapid deployment is just a small glimpse of the scalability of Pythnet and the pull oracle model. As the L1/L2 thesis continues playing out, you can expect demand for Pyth data to multiply evermore.In fact, demand has more than skyrocketed. With the launch of our Pyth Stats page, the community can observe an an exponential growth in data consumption on our cross-chain price update chart. Over the past week alone, the Pyth has delivered over 100K on-demand updates per day. More startling is the realization that the price updates chart currently does not show every chain where Pyth is available, such as Solana.We will continue updating the the stats widget. In the meanwhile, you may be tantalized by tales of Helix on Injective consuming over 50K price updates per day, and Mars on Osmosis contributing another 10K updates,You may have also realized that Kwenta and Gelato are working on a decentralized price scheduler for the Pyth Price Feeds. Decentralized applications will soon be able to fund a decentralized set of keepers or automation bots that programmatically pull Pyth prices on-chain at a pre-defined frequency. The result: steady price updates for early-phase builders looking to adopt and survey Pyth price feeds. More announcements on this to follow.It must be DeFi summer again.
