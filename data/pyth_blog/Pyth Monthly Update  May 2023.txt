Pyth Monthly Update  May 2023
‚ÄúMay, more than any other month of the year, wants us to feel most alive.‚Äù ‚Äî Fennel HudsonMay has been an explosive month for the Pyth Network, as it joined forces with long-time leaders and exciting upstarts across a multitude of L1 and L2 ecosystems.It‚Äôs our honor to power heavyweights such as Vela, the Arbitrum DEX, and Beluga, the multi-chain oracle-based AMM. Familiar names like Vyper, the DeFi derivatives layer Solana and now Arbitrum, have also integrated Pyth for interesting use cases like on-chain forex trading. But wait, there's more! Pyth's real-time data is also supporting Lyra, Pika Protocol, and Conduit Finance on Optimism, and Helix on Injective (Cosmos).April showers, May flowers. Let a thousand bloom: we‚Äôre looking forward to seeing the results of the Solana Summer Bootcamp and Hackathon, hosted by Encode Club and supported by Phantom, Wormhole, and of course, the Pyth Network.
