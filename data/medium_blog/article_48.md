Auros will be providing the Pyth network with data for a range of cryptocurrency symbols.

Auros is the 70th first-party publisher to join the network! We look forward to further joining forces with more amazing partners to build the digital data marketplace we all need — a marketplace for institutional-grade, high-fidelity financial data made accessible for any application on any blockchain.

**Who is Auros?**

* Auros is an algorithmic trading and market-making firm that delivers best-in-class liquidity for exchanges and token projects
* Combining the technological innovation that powers Auros high-frequency trading strategies with a unique partnership-based approach, Auros is redefining liquidity provision and sustainable growth in the digital assets space.

Ben Roth, Co-Founder, and CIO of Auros, said, “Auros is thrilled to be joining the Pyth network and helping to contribute reliable, high fidelity data for all. By sharing our high-frequency trading data with a truly on-chain decentralized network, we aim to foster the sort of innovation that will lead to better financial solutions for all participants. We expect the Pyth network will become an invaluable part of a future decentralized financial system and are delighted to be partnered with them on this mission.”

Stephen Kaminsky, Special Projects at Jump Crypto, one of the leading institutions supporting Pyth, also commented, “Pyth has attracted the most sophisticated trading firms in both traditional and digital asset markets, so it is of no surprise, though still fantastic, to see another premier high-frequency market maker join the Pyth community. Auros price data will undoubtedly help empower more projects and DeFi and more protocols in Web3.”
