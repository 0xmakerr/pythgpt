**Who is Gemini?**

* Gemini was founded in 2014, by brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, to unlock the next era of financial, creative, and personal freedom. It was also the first company to launch bitcoin futures contracts in December 2017. The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) used Gemini’s bitcoin prices as the basis for the daily settlement of the bitcoin futures.
* Gemini is a New York trust company that is held to the highest level of fiduciary obligations, capital reserve requirements, and banking compliance standards. With hundreds of employees worldwide, the company has offices in the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Singapore.
* In November 2021, Gemini raised $400 million led by Morgan Creek Digital, valued at $7.1 billion

Marshall Beard, Chief Strategy Officer of Gemini commented, “As a data publisher to Pyth, we are delighted to continue contributing to the growth of the DeFi ecosystem by providing our real-time price information to protocols and projects on-chain. At Gemini, we provide customers with accurate, real-time data on crypto prices. We are excited to expand our data contribution to the Pyth oracle, the leading oracle in DeFi today. The Pyth Network is a specialized oracle solution for latency-sensitive financial data that is typically kept within the “walled gardens’’ of centralized institutions. It operates one of the largest and most reliable oracle networks, deriving price data from more than 60 leading institutions, both in crypto and traditional finance. Our partnership with the Pyth Network to bring valuable financial market data to DeFi applications and the general public directly aligns with our mission to unlock the next era of financial, creative, and personal freedom.”

We look forward to further coordinating with many amazing partners to establish a digital marketplace of institutional grade, high-fidelity financial data, and power any financial dApps regardless of their blockchain base.
