![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*KIVjiKu7eb-rAkLQeZR1FQ.png)We are thrilled to welcome [Talos](https://talos.com/), a leading institutional technology provider for digital asset trading, within the Pyth network to provide trusted and verifiable market data to decentralized applications.

**Who is Talos?**

* Talos is a leading institutional-grade infrastructure technology provider that supports the full lifecycle of digital asset trading, from price discovery to execution through to settlement.
* Engineered by a team with unmatched experience in building institutional trading systems, the platform is trusted by many of the world’s largest market participants, using it to forge bi-lateral relationships with all members of the crypto trading ecosystem.

**Proven Track Record:**

* Founded in 2018, Talos has rapidly scaled its business since announcing its platform last October. In May, Talos announced the completion of a $40 million Series A investment round led by Andreessen Horowitz and investments from PayPal Ventures, Fidelity Investments, Galaxy Digital, Elefund, Illuminate Financial, and STEADFAST Capital Ventures.

Data oracle networks like Pyth serve as the connection between blockchains and the data sources necessary for DeFi applications. This partnership will include Talos providing real-time, first-party crypto market data from its large institutional client base.

“The acceleration in institutional adoption of digital assets is continuing at a rapid pace and so is DeFi,” said Anton Katz, Founder and CEO of Talos. “We are excited to be a part of this exciting project that serves at the core of DeFi infrastructure and has the potential to unlock greater efficiency and transparency in our financial system.”
