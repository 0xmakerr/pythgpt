![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*dXVWdJsI0q-hzIPiP2Ct1w.jpeg)We are excited to welcome [OKX](https://www.okx.com/), the second-biggest global crypto exchange by trading volume, to the Pyth network. OKX will contribute its real-time market data for crypto assets to the network, which will further increase Pyth’s market coverage and robustness.

**What is OKX?**

* OKX is the second biggest global crypto exchange by trading volume and a leading web3 ecosystem
* Trusted by more than 20 million global customers, OKX is known for being the fastest and most reliable crypto trading app for investors and professional traders everywhere
* In 2021, OKX processed more than 25 billion trades, while trading volumes reached over $21 trillion. OKX traders saw 220 new pairs listed across all markets in the year
* Beyond OKX’s exchange, the OKX Wallet is the platform’s latest offering for people looking to explore the world of NFTs and the metaverse while trading GameFi and DeFi tokens

Lennix Lai, OKX Director of Financial Markets said: “Given the recent liquidation events in DeFi, we understand that a high-performance, robust, and low-latency market data oracle service is crucial in developing financial products in DeFi. The Pyth network, with sub-second latency and its rapidly growing network of highly respected data partners, is an example of this exciting potential.”

We look forward to further joining forces with more amazing partners to build the digital data marketplace we all need — a marketplace for institutional-grade, high-fidelity financial data made accessible for any application on any blockchain.
