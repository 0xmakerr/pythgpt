We’ve met passionate builders all across the globe. The dedication we’ve seen on every blockchain is a testament to the resiliency of our shared ecosystem. Even in the face of extraordinary adversity, never once has the Pythian community wavered from its core mission. Furthermore, the case for transparent, trustless, and decentralized financial systems is stronger than ever. This year is a turning point for blockchain history, as well as for the Pyth journey.

**We wouldn’t be here without you.**
------------------------------------

As we sign off on one of the most eventful (and perhaps surreal) years, we would like to thank everyone who helped make the Pyth network what it is: a next-generation solution for liberating data to those who need it.

To our [data provider community](https://pyth.network/developers), we say thank you for contributing your proprietary market data to the network: you are the fuel of Pyth, and its data feeds.

To our [data users](https://pyth.network/consumers) from so many blockchains, we thank you for building with us and shaping the development direction of our network.

To our many thousands of followers across [all our socials](https://linktr.ee/PythNetwork) — thank you dearly for your continuous support and love!

The events of 2022 may not have been easily predicted by most. This oracle will venture a prognosis, however: our accomplishments of 2022 are merely a prelude for what’s to come after. The network’s success across 2023 shall be shared with all Pythians and contributors, and the world will become #PoweredByPyth.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*P2JADMpfRkTcVMBq)Before we enter the new year, let’s wrap up this one and take one last look back. The speeds of Web3 are dizzying — it’s easy to forget just how far we’ve come.

**What’s Next?**
================

[We’re still on track](/pyths-next-steps-7853b85448db). The big picture hasn’t changed. Nor have the brushstrokes. Pyth data will continue expanding to new L1 and L2 blockchains and diversifying across new asset classes and even data types.

Once again, we’re beyond grateful for the support and participation of our community: with new opportunities for network participation on the horizon, it’s an exciting time to be a part of the Pythian ecosystem. Great things are in store for everyone — data providers, data users, and community champions.

Stay tuned, and have a wonderful holiday. We’ll see you in the new year.
