![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*MYBdgNHgBoA2W9-PnPz-Qg.jpeg)We are thrilled to announce that the Pyth network is now available to all protocols using Neon‘s EVM. This implementation empowers any Ethereum applications deployed on Solana via Neon EVM to access Pyth network’s high fidelity price feeds and to power their protocols.

[Neon EVM](https://neon-labs.org/) is a tool that allows Ethereum-like transactions to be processed on [Solana](https://docs.solana.com/introduction), taking full advantage of the functionality native to Solana, including the ability to execute transactions in parallel. As such, Neon EVM allows dApps to operate with the low gas fees, high transaction speeds, and high throughput made possible by Solana, as well as access to the growing Solana market. Many prominent protocols like Aave and SushiSwap have announced that they will port their protocols to Solana via Neon. You can read more about Neon Labs [here](https://docs.neon-labs.org/docs/intro).

[Pyth](https://pyth.network/) is a next-generation oracle specially designed to publish high-fidelity financial market data at sub-second latency onto the Solana blockchain and to republish that data onto other blockchains via [Wormhole](https://wormholebridge.com/#/). The Pyth network will be a decentralized, blockchain-based marketplace for aggregated data.

Data owners will be able to contribute their data to the Pyth network and earn rewards for their data provision, while consumers of data will be able to access aggregated market data directly from a blockchain and consume it from their on-chain or off-chain application.

The Pyth network has already gathered more than [40 prominent financial institutions](https://pyth.network/publishers/) as data publishers for various asset classes. Pyth price feeds have been available on the Solana mainnet since August 2021. Leading Solana dApps have integrated with Pyth network, including [Mango Markets](https://mango.markets/), [Drift](https://www.drift.trade/), [Bonfida](https://bonfida.org/#/), [Synthetify](https://synthetify.io/), [Solend](https://solend.fi/), [Port Finance](https://port.finance/), [Jet Protocol](https://www.jetprotocol.io/) and [Project Larix](https://projectlarix.com/).
