Starting this summer, Kaiko will provide low latency crypto price data to the Pyth network through its institutional-grade data infrastructure, and securely deliver quality off-chain market data to power smart contracts and bring transparency to all actors in the space.

**Who is Kaiko?**

* Kaiko was founded in 2014 with the mission to become the foundation of the new digital finance economy by serving as a single source for market information from both centralized and decentralized marketplaces
* Kaiko collects data from over 100 centralized and decentralized exchanges, makes 100 million API calls per week, and supports +120,000 spot, futures, and options data points

Ambre Soubiran, CEO of Kaiko, commented: “Kaiko is thrilled to be supporting the Pyth network and be a part of the impressive Pyth community. We believe high-quality data is essential to the DeFi space to foster market efficiency and industry openness, and becoming a publisher was a natural step to reinforce our mission to bridge on and off-chain market data.”

We look forward to further coordinating with amazing partners to establish a digital marketplace of institutional grade, high fidelity financial data to power any financial dApps regardless of their blockchain base and offer the best data to the world.
