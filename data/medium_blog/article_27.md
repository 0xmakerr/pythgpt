![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*4Napty4UQUFjz7eZ_7NU9Q.jpeg)We are excited to welcome [DWF Labs](https://www.dwf-labs.com/), a global digital asset market maker and multi-stage web3 investment firm, to the network. DWF Labs will both contribute its proprietary market data for digital assets to Pyth and leverage the Pyth price feeds.

**What is DWF Labs?**

* DWF Labs is a global leading digital asset market maker and multi-stage Web3 investment firm, providing support from token listing to market making to OTC trading solutions.
* With offices in Singapore, Switzerland, the UAE, South Korea, and BVI, DWF Labs is part of the parent firm Digital Wave Finance (DWF), which consistently ranks among the top 5 trading entities by volume in the cryptocurrency world through its proprietary technology for high-frequency trading.
* DWF Labs supports the journey of Web3 projects by providing liquidity through token investment. Monthly, DWF Labs invests in an average of 10 projects, regardless of market conditions. GameFi, Metaverse, Infrastructure, Protocols, Trading, and DeFi are some of the targeted segments for investment.

*“As one of the world’s top crypto high-frequency traders, we can access extremely valuable data that the whole industry can benefit from,”* said Andrei Grachev, the Managing Partner of DWF Labs. *“By supplying our trading and pricing data to the Pyth Network, and at the same time by integrating their data in our existing workflows, we are making the web3 industry more resilient.”*

*“More data for everyone means greater transparency, improved scalability, and enhanced reliability for the web3 community as a whole,”* commented Lingling Jiang, Head of Regional Sales in the Liquid Markets division of DWF Labs.

Abhimanyu Bansal, a contributor to Pyth Network, said *“Pyth has established a network of the top trading firms publishing real time market data directly on-chain. As one of the leading global crypto trading firms, DWF Labs’ contribution to Pyth will be of immense value as we continue to scale and build the future of Web3, and we are very excited to welcome them to the network.”*

We look forward to further joining forces with more amazing partners to build the digital data marketplace we all need — a marketplace for institutional-grade, high-fidelity financial data made accessible for any application on any blockchain.
