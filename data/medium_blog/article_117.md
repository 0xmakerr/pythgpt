**Who is Three Arrows Capital?**

* Three Arrows Capital, established in 2012 in Singapore by Su Zhu and Kyle Davies, has become a leading voice in the crypto ecosystem.
* Three Arrows Capital focused on quantitative FX, Options, Equities, and Crypto trading before eventually fully pivoting to crypto in 2018.
* While vocal on social and the podcast circuits, the co-founder duo rarely announces their investment size in public. However, it was known that their stake in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust reached close to $2B in April 2021.
* Additionally, the fund has been known to invest in top-tier crypto projects like Polkadot, DY/DX, Aave, Lido, MINA, Avalanche, Solana, and [many more](https://www.threearrowscap.com/select-investments/). They recently led a [$150M funding round](https://cointelegraph.com/news/near-protocol-raises-150m-to-promote-web3-adoption) for developing on NEAR Protocol, a promising L1 with proof-of-stake technology. They are also actively investing in equities of prominent crypto companies such as Deribit, Fireblocks, and BlockFi.

Three Arrows Capital will contribute its proprietary market data for crypto assets.
