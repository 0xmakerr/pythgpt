![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*1UCVHpJm3X79dSQ3zWc2Gg.png)We are delighted to announce the Pyth network’s deployment on the BNB Chain (Testnet) and our integration into the BNB Application Sidechains (BAS) Testnet. BNB Chain users and applications can now leverage Pyth’s first-party financial data.

Thanks to [Wormhole](https://wormholenetwork.com/en/), Pyth is able to stream high-fidelity financial data to BNB Chain. This deployment is a major step in Pyth’s mission to empower developers across all ecosystems, whether they are building on- or off-chain.

We are proud to join the BNB ecosystem at a [crucial stage in its development](https://www.bnbchain.world/en/blog/bsc-2022-build-and-build/) towards mass adoption. We look forward to supporting BNB Chain’s developers in their quest to build the future of finance.

Mike Cahill, Director of the Pyth Data Association, said, “Pyth’s integration with BNB Chain is a significant milestone in our mission to empower developers across all ecosystems with hi-fidelity data. With its energy efficiency and ultra-low-cost, instantaneous transactions, it is no surprise that BNB Chain has become one of the most popular blockchains in the world. We are proud to join the BNB ecosystem and look forward to supporting developers as they build the future of finance [– powered by Pyth].”

Patrick Degenhardt, Vice President at [BNB Chain](https://www.bnbchain.world) Labs, said, “Pyth has quickly established a strong reputation for its high-quality, uncompromising data that developers and dApps rely on to fuel visionary projects. We are thrilled to partner with the Pyth network as we continue to build the infrastructure underpinning Web3.”

Brad Harrison, CEO of [Venus](https://venus.io/), said, “We are pleased to serve as the launch partner to Pyth on BNB Chain, which represents an exciting development for the dApp community. Access to time-sensitive, real-world data is critical, especially in times of volatility, and Pyth’s game-changing precision and reliability will usher in a new era of innovation for the BNB community.”

Join us and the greater BNB community at the [BNB Chain Revelation Summit](https://www.bnbchain.world/en/revelation-summit) (May 31, 10 AM UTC) for a discussion on the BNB Chain Vision and Roadmap, plus many other exciting topics!
