Argamon Markets will initially contribute its proprietary market data for Forex, Commodities, and Crypto, with plans to scale into other assets, as DeFi and project demand scales.

**Who is Argamon Markets?**

* Argamon is a multi-asset proprietary trading firm dedicated to market making, optimizing financial market liquidity, and managing Prime Broker relationships

Elan Bension, Board Director and Co-Founder of Argamon Markets along with Jeremy Kinstlinger, said “We anticipate that the Pyth network will revolutionize the way pricing market data is used on blockchain, and we are extremely excited to be joining this innovative network. We believe the Pyth network will soon become an integral part of our evolving industry, paving the way for more efficient data pricing services.”

“The Pyth network, which enables on-chain protocols access to off-chain data, is at its core a bridge. So to see such a strong player in traditional financial markets like Argamon join the network by contributing their top-tier data is just another example of how Pyth continues to scale and serve as a core piece of infrastructure for the growth of crypto and DeFi.” Commented Stephen Kaminsky, Jump Crypto Special Projects, one of the lead firms helping to support the oracle.
