![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*FKa9OU1RcuNysEh_FQ7fRg.jpeg)**We are thrilled to announce a new series of conversations with some of our close partners in the publisher community!**

Pyth has garnered interest across the crypto world as well as the traditional finance ecosystem. Now with more than [65 data publishers onboarded](https://pyth.network/publishers/), we are beyond excited to share some of the stories that have motivated, and continue to inspire, their participation in Pyth.

In this first discussion, we hear from **Stephen Kaminsky** at [Jump Crypto](https://jumpcrypto.com/), who asks questions to **Michael Lie** at [Flow Traders](https://www.flowtraders.com/), two of our data contributors. **Flow Traders** is one of Pyth’s data publishers specializing in Exchange Traded Products (ETPs), and it has contributed its digital assets data since the network was still in its infancy last year. Here’s how the conversation went.
