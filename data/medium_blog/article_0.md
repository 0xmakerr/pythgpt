=========================

We’re excited to announce that we will migrate our Medium blog to the Pyth network website at <https://pyth.network/blog>.

Our migration is a first step of a longer journey. We’re pleased to bring you along for the ride as we explore new creative ways to educate developers about Pyth’s data solution and empower the broader DeFi community to take ownership over the data securing their smart contracts.

Our blog migration will move all of our past Medium articles to our new [**blog**](https://pyth.network/blog), and new blog content will come through our blog page on our website.

Exciting updates are also on the horizon, as we’re gearing up to deliver a fresh wave of content for all DeFi participants:

* Timely leadership pieces to help inform builders and Web3 enthusiasts
* Regular new feature and partner announcements
* Industry and landscape analysis
* New podcasts and interviews
* And lots more!

Your feedback is important to us, and we’re always ready to hear about the types of content you want to see. You can fill out [this survey](https://yyyf63zqhtu.typeform.com/to/ro9bvdU0) and submit your suggestions.
