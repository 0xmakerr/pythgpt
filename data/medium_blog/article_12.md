![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*3yQvKaFXKV5TTXRNGqWz0A.jpeg)We’re excited to announce that Pyth data feeds are now available on [Base](https://base.org/), a new Ethereum Layer 2 incubated by Coinbase. Base will serve as a home for [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/)’s on-chain products and an open ecosystem where anyone can build!

We look forward to supporting the Base DeFi community and helping grow the broader Layer 2 ecosystem by unlocking once-inaccessible financial data for builders. Developers on Base Testnet can now access [Pyth’s 200+ price feeds](https://pyth.network/price-feeds/). Our integration with Ethereum layer 2 Base is made possible thanks to [Wormhole](https://wormholenetwork.com/) and many Base contributors.

*“We’re excited that Pyth is deploying on Base to support developers looking to build the future of finance and DeFi on-chain” — Jesse Pollak, Base Lead*
