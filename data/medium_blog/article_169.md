![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*ZAsCbopclvMUdcCn)Welcome to the first installment of the **Pythiad**, the official Pyth network newsletter!

We’ve accomplished much in the past three months. From our [hello world](/today-were-beyond-excited-to-introduce-the-pyth-network-a-next-generation-oracle-solution-735a27504358) announcement to our new parade of data provider [announcements](/new-pyth-data-provider-the-bermuda-stock-exchange-ccf3c04bd430), the pieces are coming together.

[Pyth network](https://pyth.network) is a vision coming to life: one that imagines the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) gaining comprehensive access to high-fidelity (HiFi) financial markets data securely and reliably.

*Pyth connects high-fidelity market data from the world’s largest professional traders and exchanges to any smart contract, anywhere.​*

To our followers, we say thank you for your incredible support and energy! And to our newcomers, we say welcome aboard. We’re so happy to have you all with us.

This month’s newsletter has something for everyone. This issue will most likely be longer than our future installments. There’s much to discuss.
