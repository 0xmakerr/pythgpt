=====================

The Pyth network launched into mainnet on August 2021 after many months of building, surprising many with its [mission](/today-were-beyond-excited-to-introduce-the-pyth-network-a-next-generation-oracle-solution-735a27504358) to make every asset price available on every chain.

Members of our early community asked many thoughtful questions: Where does Pyth’s data come from, where will Pyth data be available, what keeps Pyth data fast and accurate, and — *perhaps most importantly* — where ***does*** the name “Pyth” come from?

Is it perhaps a reference to Python, the object-oriented programming language?

We get that a lot — and while the Github does provide a [Python client](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-client-py), the name “Pyth” is actually a callback to a much older and spiritually profound legacy, rooted deeply in ancient Greek history and mythology…
