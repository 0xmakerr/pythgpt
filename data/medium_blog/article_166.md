**Who is CMS?**

* CMS is a principal investment firm that operates in the cryptocurrency space.

CMS will contribute a wide range of data it interacts with across the crypto ecosystem, while also providing a unique perspective on what founders and developers need to build successful products. “Pyth stands to be a top oracle solution by providing high-fidelity market data to the DeFi ecosystem. It is a crucial piece of the developing Solana universe and we believe the Pyth team is more than capable to see this project through to its highest potential.” Daniel Matuszewski, Founding Partner of CMS.
