![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*Ryg-UUJhAU8GcxFpjJqjaQ.png)We are pleased to welcome [0x Labs](https://0x.org/), a global blockchain company building decentralized exchange infrastructure for the internet, within the Pyth network to create a world where transparency is a core tenant.

**Who is 0x Labs?**

* 0x Labs are the creators and core contributors to the 0x Protocol, a decentralized exchange infrastructure for the internet.
* Founded in 2017, the project has been used by many digital asset businesses to incorporate exchange functionality into their applications and create new markets for digital assets.

**Proven Track Record:**

* Since its inception, the 0x Protocol has enabled the exchange of more than $94 billion in tokenized value across approximately 18 million crypto trades.

0x Labs will provide real-time crypto pricing data from the 0x network to the Pyth network to improve DeFi market transparency.

0x Labs co-founder and co-CEO, Will Warren, commented, “0x Labs’ mission is to create a tokenized world where all value can flow freely, and transparency is a core tenant of that mission. Pyth’s vision of providing broad access to high-fidelity market data to create more transparency in the DeFi space aligns perfectly with our mission. We’re excited to partner with Pyth and to contribute real-time market data from 0x, the first open protocol for peer-to-peer exchange of digital assets.”
