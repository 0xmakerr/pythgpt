![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*PpbMOlKAOQwphg-_eCad3g.jpeg)**We are excited to release the third installment of the Pyth Publisher Series, featuring Theodore Rozencwajg, CEO and Co-Founder at** [**D2X**](https://www.d2x.com/)**!**

Pyth has garnered interest across the worlds of crypto and traditional finance. Over 75 [data publishers](https://pyth.network/publishers/) have now joined the network, and each publisher has its story to tell.

In today’s discussion, we hear from Theodore Rozencwajg at D2X, the soon-to-be-regulated *(EU MTF License currently under application)* pan-European digital derivatives exchange. D2X joined the network earlier this year in [September](/new-pyth-data-provider-d2x-1e6dac03242f). What inspired them to join the Pyth network and to contribute to their data? What do they envision for the future of blockchain and decentralized finance? Theodore provides a thoughtful and positive outlook.
