“WOO X is dedicated to building more robust DeFi ecosystems. Pyth network’s technology and early adoption by leading institutions make it ideal for collaboration. We see Pyth as a way to contribute our market data, support DeFi ecosystems, and cultivate strong relationships with other top institutions in the crypto space.” Jack Tan, CEO
