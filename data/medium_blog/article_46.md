![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*2_MGimZueXJVvsOWVp1qXg.jpeg)We are stoked to welcome [Flowdesk](https://www.flowdesk.co/), a globally-based financial technology company, to the Pyth network. Flowdesk will contribute its proprietary market data for crypto assets to the network.

**Who is Flowdesk?**

* Founded in 2020, Flowdesk combines significant experience from traditional markets with acute knowledge of algorithmic trading and crypto.
* Flowdesk provides a wide range of digital asset services, such as market-making, custody, brokerage, and treasury management.
* Flowdesk is made by unique individuals who are technologists, innovation-driven, and convinced by the positive impacts crypto will have on the world.

Guilhem Chaumont, CEO of Flowdesk, stated, “*As a crypto-financial technology provider, Flowdesk is committed to keeping up with the latest technological developments in DeFi. We are willing to push crypto-financial products and web3 adoption to the next level. Creating a consortium on real-time on-chain market data is a mandatory step to build the decentralized calculation agent required by crypto derivatives, and we are looking forward to participating in this great project.”*

Stephen Kaminsky, Special Projects at Jump Crypto, one of the firms helping support Pyth, also commented, *“Flowdesk has established itself as a top player in trading infrastructure, particularly for crypto, which makes them a fantastic partner for Pyth, a project we believe to be at the core of DeFi infrastructure going forward.”*

We look forward to further joining forces with more amazing partners to build the digital data marketplace we all need — a marketplace for institutional-grade, high-fidelity financial data made accessible for any application on any blockchain.
