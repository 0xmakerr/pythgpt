Pyth Monthly Update  April 2023
‚ÄúApril was just beginning‚Ä¶and a breath of spring could be felt in the soft, cold air.‚Äù ‚Äî Anton ChekovAs brighter days are looming, excitement is creeping up throughout the DeFi world!Most excited are, undoubtedly, the teams becoming #PoweredByPyth. The availability of the Pyth‚Äôs low-latency pull oracles has set off a blossoming effect: more volume, more trading, and more users as Pyth expands to five new blockchains, including Injective, Neon EVM, Conflux Shimmer, and Meter this month.As the days start warming up, so are our #PoweredByPyth partners: new launches like DeriTrade on zkSync Era; and new all-time-highs in trading volume across Drift ($500M), Uniwhale ($300M), Morphex ($250M), CAP Finance exceeding ($150M), and Tigris ($100M).We‚Äôre always pleased to welcome new teams to the network and support their growth. Reactor Fusion became the number one money-market protocol on zkSync Era overnight, while Forge, a synthetics protocol on Arbitrum, decided to expand its product offering through Pyth‚Äôs 200+ price feeds.It‚Äôs always good to take a step back and reflect on how far we‚Äôve come. Last year, the network introduced a new type of low-latency pull oracles for devlivering real-time prices to multiple chains in a gas-efficient manner. As of today, our #PoweredByPyth partners have permissionlessly requested over 1,000,000 price update on-chain! Things are warming up for a Pythian summer‚Ä¶ü§ù PartnershipsWho‚Äôs #PoweredByPyth?
