What‚Äôs New in the Ecosystem?A Milli, A MilliIn December 2022, the Pyth network introduced an innovative low-latency pull oracle model‚Äîthe result of long R&D since the beginning of that year. The pull model empowers users to ‚Äúpull‚Äù available prices off-chain (from Pythnet) and make them available on-chain when needed, enabling everyone in that blockchain environment to utilize that price point.By April 2023, the Pyth‚Äôs pull oracles received over 1 million on-chain, cross-chain price update request from over 100 #PoweredByPyth applications across 18 blockchains!Price updates peaked on March 12 at 25,000 price update requests, a day marked by the USDC de-peg. The growing Pyth ecosystem is now pushing towards greater heights!Looking back at the last five months of usage, it‚Äôs clear that Pyth‚Äôs new design improves on existing oracles in many dimensions, especially scalability.On-demand price updates eliminate the transaction costs paid by the oracle and data providers, enabling the oracle to scale in ways that traditional push oracles cannot. Consequently, Pyth‚Äôs low-latency data feeds can support extremely high-frequency price updates for thousands of price feeds across a virtually unlimited number of blockchains.Overcome Your LimitationsThe most valuable Web3 and DeFi services need oracles ‚Äî but developers face limitations with current solutions. Enter Pyth.Pyth's low-latency pull oracles were built to offer developers and DeFi with high-frequency updates, extensive asset selection, and transparent, trustworthy data sourcing.Gone are the days where you trade at a price from 10 minutes ago and not the current price. Pyth's prices update more than once a second, ensuring that dApps have the most recent data.Gone are the days where DeFi protocols can support limited assets. Pyth offers builders across nearly 20 blockchains a catalog of over 200 price feeds. This makes Pyth the go-to oracle for applications that are aiming for a multi-chain deployment.Gone are the days where DeFi protocols rely on unknown and obscure data API. Pyth‚Äôs first-party design means your data come directly from the source of financial market prices‚Äîthe market participants themselves.Don‚Äôt just take our word for it. Tune into Jayant as he explains how you can build better apps with Pyth.Pyth Low-Latency Pull Oracles Launches on NeonEVM DevnetLast week, the newest iteration of the Neon EVM (devnet), the first smart contract on Solana acting as the Ethereum Virtual Machine, has become #PoweredByPyth.As a smart contract on Solana, Neon EVM benefits from Solana‚Äôs low gas fees (up to 0.000015 SOL per transaction) and high throughput (over 2K TPS). This makes Neon EVM the cheapest and most efficient way to run Ethereum dApps!"We are joining forces with Pyth to empower builders across the Neon ecosystem with access to high-fidelity financial data. This collaboration creates a dynamic environment that supports accurate price discovery, improved risk assessment, and enhanced transparency," said Marina Guryeva, director of the Neon Foundation. "Our strategic partnership enables developers to innovate and build reliable DeFi applications, strengthening a robust and accessible decentralized financial infrastructure for all.‚ÄùWe look forward to enabling the EVM DeFi community to enjoy the benefits of Solana‚Äôs technology.Pyth Low-Latency Pull Oracles Launches on ShimmerEVM TestnetPyth‚Äôs low-latency pull oracles became available on the ShimmerEVM test chain in April. ShimmerEVM will be the first L2 chain to deploy on Shimmer, the L1 staging and validation network of the IOTA distributed ledger technology (DLT).To help bootstrap the ecosystem, the Tangle Ecosystem Association (TEA) will deploy and automate its own price pusher for six asset pairs: SMR/USD, IOTA/USD, ETH/USD, BTC/USD, USDC/USD, USDT/USD.The price data for these pairs will be pushed onto the EVM chain at regular intervals and according to certain volatility parameters. Once these prices are available on-chain, applications on ShimmerEVM can freely leverage them in their operations. TEA will make its price pushing service available for as long as network demand necessitates.We look forward to supporting the Shimmer DeFi community and helping grow the broader ecosystem by unlocking once-inaccessible financial data for builders.#PoweredByPyth ApplicationsEveryday, new applications become #PoweredByPyth and existing ones achieve new milestones!In the perpetuals world, we saw Drift (Solana) reaching the $500M volume milestone since inception.Buffer Finance, recently integrated on Arbitrum, has generated $500K in fees!Uniwhale, a perp DEX on BNB Chain, has surpassed the $300M mark.CAP Finance, #PoweredByPyth on Arbitrum, processed $165M in a single day of trading!Tigris reached $100M in trading volume since integrated with Pyth on Polygon and Arbitrum.Morphex, having recently become #PoweredByPyth on Fantom, has facilitated over $200M in trading volume in just 8 weeks post launch!Recent and upcoming trading protocols #PoweredByPyth to be on the look out for: GooseFX on Solana, D8X on Polygon zkEVM, and Deri Protocol on BNB Chain, Arbitrum and zkSync.Synthetics protocols have also experienced a resurgence lately, driven by Pyth‚Äôs extensive asset coverage across crypto and real-world assets! Just take a look at our new #PoweredByPyth partners:Synthex, a trustless synthetic asset issuance and trading protocol built on ArbitrumForge, a new DeFi protocol enabling anyone to mint and trade real-world assets on ArbitrumLast but not least, Pyth‚Äôs low-latency pull oracles have been the go-to oracle provider for the zkSync borrow-lending ecosystem:Nexon, zkSync‚Äôs first money market platform, has launched on mainnetReactor Fusion, the number one lending market in value locked, is also #PoweredByPythIt‚Äôs starting to look like Pyth is setting and becoming a new industry standard üëÄWe can‚Äôt wait to hear what you think!
