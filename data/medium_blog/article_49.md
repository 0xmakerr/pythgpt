In this spirit, we are excited to invite the developer community to [**xHack**](https://jumpcrypto.com/xhack/) **by** [**Wormhole**](https://twitter.com/wormholecrypto) at [**The Pit**](https://jumpcrypto.com/thepit/): a Chicago-based cross-chain hackathon running from September 26th to October 21st.

We’re all in this together. You can look forward to Pyth **workshops**, educational **seminars**, and a **$10K bounty** for building cross-chain with Pyth data!

The xHack month-long hackathon is the first of its kind: builders from **15 different chains** will come together and hack away. With the recent launch of [Pythnet](/introducing-pythnet-f54192c355c5), xHack by Wormhole came at the perfect time.
