![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*28Ua4hjFKII8K6vQKMnJ_w.jpeg)We’re delighted to announce that [Pyth Price Feeds](https://pyth.network/price-feeds) are now integrated into [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/), the leading charting platform and social network trusted by 50M+ traders and investors worldwide! Starting today, anyone using TradingView can now access Pyth historical and live price data from the TradingView [website](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=PYTH), as well from their [off-chain API](https://www.tradingview.com/rest-api-spec/).

*“We’re excited to bring Pyth to the TradingView ecosystem and give our global customers access to their high fidelity on-chain data as well as derivative instruments for global markets,”* said Pierce Crosby, General Manager at TradingView. *“We have been watching the Pyth contributor ecosystem grow for some time, with major traditional finance firms and native crypto networks adding datasets. The scale of the data is tremendous, and we see that it makes sense to share these contributions to the larger investor universe.”*

*“The addition of Pyth data to TradingView, the number one platform for charting financial data with over 50 million users, is a major success for the network and will further empower existing and prospective users of Pyth data”*, said Mike Cahill, a Director of the Pyth Data Association. *“Not only this integration will increase the reach of the Pyth price feeds to the world, but this will enable any #PoweredByPyth applications to quickly super-charge its user interface with the TradingView plugin.”*
