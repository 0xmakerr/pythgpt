![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*se0bdsq67HeP-S5PprkHew.jpeg)We’re excited to announce that **Pyth data feeds are now live on** [**Cronos**](https://cronos.org/), the leading EVM-compatible chain build on the Cosmos SDK. Cronos-based applications like [Fulcrom](https://fulcrom.finance/), a decentralized perpetual exchange, are already leveraging Pyth data to offer soon-to-be-revealed products!

We look forward to supporting the broader Cronos ecosystem by unlocking once inaccessible financial data for builders. Builders on Cronos chain can now access [Pyth’s 200+ price feeds](https://pyth.network/price-feeds/) for equities, commodities, foreign exchange pairs, and cryptocurrency! Our integration with Cronos is made possible thanks to [Wormhole](https://wormholenetwork.com/) and many leading Cronos contributors.

*“We are excited to announce the integration of Pyth network with the Cronos chain. With Pyth’s integration, Cronos developers can now access reliable, accurate and real-time data feeds that are crucial for onchain smart contracts to interact with off-chain data sources.”* said Ella Qiang, Head of Ecosystem at Cronos Labs. *“We look forward to seeing the positive impact this partnership will have on the Cronos ecosystem and our DeFi community.”*
