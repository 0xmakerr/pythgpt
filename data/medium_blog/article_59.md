![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*DBiHJFk0GN3-YNmMtKvf5Q.jpeg)Pyth x AltonomyWe are very pleased to welcome [Altonomy](https://www.altonomy.com/#/), a world’s leading trading and asset management firm in the crypto space, to the Pyth network. Altonomy will contribute its first-party price data from its own proprietary trading strategies for digital assets.

**Who is Altonomy?**

* Altonomy is a proprietary trading firm specializing in cryptocurrencies with internal capital northwards of $500 million.
* Altonomy was founded in 2018 and is headquartered in Singapore with a global footprint.

Altonomy joins a growing roster of over 65 data publishers including top trading firms, exchanges, and crypto companies, all publishing their first-party price data to the network. Pyth aggregates this information directly on-chain and today supports equities, FX, and metals, alongside the crypto data. This information is being consumed by the top protocols and projects in DeFi, as well as several other core off-chain platforms. Natively built on Solana, Pyth recently announced its upcoming support of the BNB Chain as well as its own independent underlying code base: [Pythnet](/introducing-pythnet-f54192c355c5), to allow Pyth to scale across all layer ones through the bridging protocol, Wormhole.

“The market data infrastructure Pyth is providing to the industry is essential. For us to contribute to the effective pricing of various cryptocurrency assets, Pyth provides a great platform to engage and make sure traders are aligned,” said Ricky Li, co-founder of Altonomy. “We believe in collaboration among the most active traders to achieve effective pricing. Pyth provides us the platform to materialize that vision. We are certainly glad to be part of this community”

“This partnership between Pyth and Altonomy is another step forward in the project’s mission to become a core infrastructure layer for DeFi and Web3. Altonomy’s key focus points on trading, technology, and research closely align with our pillars at Jump Crypto, and we look forward to working alongside this great team on Pyth.” Commented Stephen Kaminsky, Special Projects at Jump.

We look forward to further joining forces with more amazing partners to build the digital data marketplace we all need — a marketplace for institutional-grade, high-fidelity financial data made accessible for any application on any blockchain.
