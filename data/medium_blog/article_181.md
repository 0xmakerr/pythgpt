At the dawn of the internet, it took a while for people to get comfortable with trusting internet companies to do the things that non-internet companies did. First-generation internet companies generally took their traditional business models and ported them online: many magazine websites, for example, were initially just PDFs of the magazine itself. Over time, attitudes changed and companies today optimize for internet-first business models.

People like to use the analogy that blockchain will turn some of the biggest internet companies into protocols and outsource their roles to incentivize market participants. We tend to agree. Over time, orthogonal *protocol-first* ways of doing things will probably become the norm, but for now, there is a focus on getting people comfortable with trusting *protocols* to do the things that *internet companies* did.

Amazon started out with an ambitious but focused objective: to become the biggest bookseller in the world by offering unbeatable low prices and unparalleled service. This required immense innovation. Amazon needed to break the mold of traditional supply chains and find new, alternative sources to be able to offer books at lower prices, as well as to constantly refine their logistics to earn consumers’ trust.

Being a big, low-priced bookseller was hardly something new: there were specialists like Barnes & Nobles, Borders, and Waldenbooks who competed for scale. Some of them also had fledgling internet offerings, and there were even websites that aggregated and compared prices across various online stores. Amazon continued to strive for greater efficiency while relentlessly bringing down costs and delivery times for their customers, creating a superior buying experience. They pushed the boundaries for shipping speeds, more generous return policies, and even competitive price pressure by showing competing stores within their own marketplace, encouraging new and different entrants to the bookselling and producing business. As we all know, after Amazon became the biggest bookseller, they were able to expand to other products, and the expertise and customer-centric focus they developed continued to serve them well.
