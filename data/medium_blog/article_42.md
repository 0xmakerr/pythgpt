![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*gKXBYepcc-8mhYH2R4qBfA.jpeg)We are delighted to announce that Pyth price feeds are now available on [BNB Chain](https://www.bnbchain.org/en) mainnet and Binance Sidechains!

Thanks to the support of [Wormhole](https://wormholenetwork.com/) and [Binance](https://binance.com/), we are proud to enable any BNB native applications to freely leverage Pyth’s high-fidelity data. Any BNB Chain program can now (permissionlessly) request and consume any of Pyth’s 80+ price feeds for equities, commodities, foreign exchange pairs, and cryptocurrency directly.

Leading this launch is [Venus Protocol](https://venus.io/), which will be the first #PoweredByPyth BNB Chain application! We are excited to partner with Venus to bring them powerful, high-resolution data to empower their borrow-lending operations.

Last but not least, the wider DeFi ecosystem can look forward to new Pyth price feeds based on the BNB ecosystem: [BUSD/USD](https://pyth.network/price-feeds/crypto-busd-usd), [TUSD/USD](https://pyth.network/price-feeds/crypto-tusd-usd), and [XVS/USD](https://pyth.network/price-feeds/crypto-xvs-usd), with more to come ([BETH/USD](https://pyth.network/price-feeds/crypto-beth-usd), [VAI/USD](https://pyth.network/price-feeds/crypto-vai-usd/)).

*“Developers and dApps have come to rely on Pyth’s high-quality, uncompromising data to power their creative ideas,”* said Gwendolyn Regina, Investment Director at BNB Chain. *“The new feature on market data for crypto feeds is a highlight of their effort to build the infrastructure for the Web3 community, allowing the community to easily access real-time data alerts”*.
