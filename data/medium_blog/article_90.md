![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*Q4558fQlJQfCERE4t7cIMw.jpeg)We are proud to announce that M@zel, a fund backed by [Eisler Capital](https://eislercapital.com/), has committed to joining the Pyth network. M@zel will initially contribute its proprietary market data for digital assets to the network, bringing its unique first-party prices — derived from its multi-strategy trading business — on-chain.

**Who is M@zel?**

* M@zel, one of the many funds backed and operated by Eisler Capital, is specifically focused on crypto assets.
* Eisler Capital is an investment management firm seeking to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns with low levels of correlation to risk assets.
* The firm leverages proprietary technology systems, advanced trade screening processes, and a disciplined risk management framework to express its views. It also uses fixed income, foreign exchange, equity, credit, and commodity instruments as its related derivatives.

A spokesperson for Eisler noted, “M@zel recognizes the importance of high quality, low-cost market data in order to enable a more efficient trading ecosystem. As such, M@zel looks forward to working with Pyth to bring low-latency market data to the crypto industry.”

We look forward to further coordinating with many amazing partners to establish a digital marketplace of institutional grade, high-fidelity financial data, and power any financial dApps regardless of their blockchain base.
