![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*1ueAMJfr5vxRqHnObd47uQ.jpeg)We are delighted to announce that the Pyth network now supports the leading decentralized stablecoin DAI in the newest [DAI/USD price feed](https://pyth.network/price-feeds/crypto-dai-usd). In partnership with [MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/en/), the Pyth DAI/USD feed enables anyone to borrow, lend, or trade on the leading decentralized stablecoin on any non-EVM chain including Solana. We look forward to working with leading Solana applications such as [Solend](https://twitter.com/solendprotocol), [Mango Markets](https://twitter.com/mangomarkets), [Bonfida](https://bonfida.org/), [Drift Protocol](https://www.drift.trade/), [Jet Protocol](https://twitter.com/JetProtocol), and [PsyOptions](https://www.psyoptions.io/) in unlocking the next generation of DeFi services through the world’s leading stablecoin.

Niklas Kunkel, Oracle Core Unit Facilitator at MakerDAO, said: *“As applications and usability of DeFi continues to grow, oracles become increasingly important to provide reliable information at a pace in line with this steady growth. As partnerships such as this become more common, the bridge between off-chain data and DeFi protocols strengthens, delivering a new era of finance. Partnering with Pyth facilitates the use of this bridge, bringing the longest standing stablecoin to the real world of finance. Having launched as recently as 2021, Pyth’s explosive introduction in the space emphasizes DeFi’s expansive growth and the need for an accessible, usable oracle.”*

Michael Cahill, Director at Pyth Data Association, said: *“As the Pyth community of publishers and consumers continues to grow, our oracle will continually grant more accurate and widespread price feeds to fuel growth across the DeFi ecosystem. Finance is changing, and this is clearly evident with the popularity of MakerDAO’s DAI stablecoin. We are very excited to see how our user base interacts with the new price feeds, and are equally excited about the overall industry impact of initiatives where the real world of traditional finance is transformed by the use of DeFi and oracles.”*
