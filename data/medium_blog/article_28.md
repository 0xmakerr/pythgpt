![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*vHq_eaHYT1S_zCFePVgZuw.jpeg)We are thrilled to announce that the [Pyth network](https://pyth.network/) has extended support for 29 US equities and is now offering to all for free 39 live equity price feeds: a first in the world!

The Pyth network was built around the tenet to bring previously inaccessible financial market data to DeFi applications and the general public to empower anyone to participate and contribute to the future of finance.

It has now been over a year since the Pyth network is live ([mainnet on 26th August 2021](/the-pyth-network-mainnet-a3d45d2c0f58)) and has been powering Solana DeFi. From a handful of publishers and consumers, the network now gathers over 75 first-party data providers, secured close to $2B for its users, and enabled over $30B in trading volume. It also recently expanded to five new chains: [BNB Chain](/bnb-chain-and-binance-sidechains-are-now-poweredbypyth-a83001bd6ef4), [Aptos](/aptos-is-now-poweredbypyth-533d0eae3538), [Ethereum](/ethereum-and-optimism-are-now-poweredbypyth-43951fd9025e), [Optimism](/ethereum-and-optimism-are-now-poweredbypyth-43951fd9025e), and [Aurora](/pyth-data-is-live-on-aurora-b03d5910b5f9), thanks to the interoperability protocol: [Wormhole](https://wormholenetwork.com/).

Today marks an important milestone as about 30 of the biggest US equities are added to the network and are available to anyone. Pyth now supports, for free, [live price feeds for 39 US equities](https://pyth.network/price-feeds?asset-type=equity) — a first in the world — with many more to come.
