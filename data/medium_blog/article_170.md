The Chicago Trading Company will initially contribute its cryptocurrency market data to Pyth network. But as the former scales, CTC plans to expand its contribution to market data for equities. We welcome CTC to our rapidly expanding group of key industry participants who share the goal of distributing precise, high caliber market data onto the blockchain to revamp “[…] age-old practices and processes like market data services” (Brett Estell, Global Co-Head of Trading at CTC).

We look forward to working together to establish a network of institutional grade, high fidelity financial market data to power the Solana and Serum ecosystems as well as those of other major chains.
