![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*Hm5D4yAnmTjc2e_w113ZJw.jpeg)We are pleased to welcome [Coin Metrics](https://coinmetrics.io/), a leading provider of crypto financial intelligence, to the Pyth network. Coin Metrics will provide the Pyth network with a fully proprietary and transparent new pricing source that promotes the functioning of efficient markets, reduces information asymmetries among market participants, facilitates trading in standardized contracts, and accelerates the adoption of cryptocurrencies as an asset class with the highest standards.

**Who is Coin Metrics?**

* Coin Metrics is the leading provider of crypto financial intelligence, offering network data, market data, indexes, and network risk solutions to the most prestigious institutions touching crypto assets.
* Coin Metrics was founded in 2017 as an open-source project to determine the economic significance of public blockchains.

“Pyth is establishing itself as a leading on-chain market data solution, opening up an obvious synergy with Coin Metrics. Our independent and transparent crypto asset prices will be additive to Pyth’s efforts to establish high-frequency updates for scalable blockchains, layer 2 solutions, and TradFi institutions,” said Tim Rice, co-founder, and CEO of Coin Metrics. “We are excited to further enhance Pyth Price Feeds by contributing our Reference Rates, and we look forward to more opportunities to bring our range of data intelligence on-chain to support more advanced DeFi products.”

Stephen Kaminsky at Jump Crypto, one of the leading institutions contributing to the network, also commented, “Coin Metrics has built an incredibly valuable and strong data platform to support the crypto community. Their mission ‘to empower people to make informed financial decisions’ closely aligns with the Pyth mission to power on-chain DeFi and Web3 protocols. Their contribution to Pyth — and ultimately consumption of Pyth data — is a natural fit and we look forward to working alongside them on this exciting project.”

We look forward to further joining forces with more amazing partners to build the digital data marketplace we all need — a marketplace for institutional-grade, high-fidelity financial data made accessible for any application on any blockchain.
