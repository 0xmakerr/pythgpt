**What is Trebuchet Network?**

* Trebuchet Network is a platform that leverages AI and machine learning to provide accurate market analysis for traders in crypto, forex, commodities, and equity.
* The platform partners with Signal Provider Partners (SPPs) and Execution Strategy Partners (ESPs) to offer trading signals and execute trades.

Trebuchet Network will be leveraging their advanced AI technology to equip the Pyth network with a reliable, advanced pricing source that encourages efficient markets, mitigates information discrepancies among market participants, and hastens the embrace of digital assets. Furthermore, Trebuchet will be incorporating the Pyth data feeds into their Forge platform as a dependable reference rate.

*“We are thrilled to be teaming up with Pyth, a leader in on-chain market data solutions,”* said Ivo Galic, CEO and founder at Trebuchet Network. *“Our advanced AI capabilities will be an invaluable asset to the Pyth mission of powering on-chain DeFi and Web3 protocols. We look forward to contributing our AI-derived prices and to bringing our range of data intelligence on-chain to support more DeFi products.”*

*“Not only does Trebuchet bring valuable new price data to Pyth, joining a growing a community of now 75 data publishers, but they also bring technical expertise in cloud architecture, blockchain technologies, and web3 infrastructure. This is a powerful partnership to help further the Pyth mission,”* said Stephen Kaminsky, Special Projects at Jump Crypto, one of the leading contributors to the Pyth network.

We look forward to further joining forces with more amazing partners to build the digital data marketplace we all need — a marketplace for institutional-grade, high-fidelity financial data made accessible for any application on any blockchain.
