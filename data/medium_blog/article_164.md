CoinShares will initially contribute its real-time crypto market data directly on-chain for the Pyth network. We welcome CoinShares to our growing roster of high quality market players and data sources with which we do share a common goal: improving the transparency and availability of cryptocurrency data.

“ […] A number of regulators have even cited the perceived lack of transparency related to crypto markets and pricing as a core reason to deny retail access to crypto ETPs and ETFs. Pyth network was an obvious partnership for us, as we continue to execute on our vision to unlock more transparency and establish trust in the broader crypto ecosystem using the underlying blockchain protocol to provide verifiable, trusted, real-time data to market participants.” said Jean-Marie Mognetti, Chief Executive Officer of CoinShares.

The Pyth network and its trusted partners look forward to further coordinating to establish a digital marketplace of institutional grade, high fidelity financial data to power dApps regardless of their blockchain base.
