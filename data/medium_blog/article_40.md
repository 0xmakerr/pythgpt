![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*v9g0hVa0iZ_1_3-OLUbQmA.jpeg)We are delighted to welcome [Orca](https://www.orca.so/) to the Pyth network as a new crypto data publisher! Orca is a leading Automated Market Maker (AMM) on Solana. Orca will contribute its crypto market data directly to the network and significantly boost Pyth’s ability to source reliable pricing data for Solana ecosystem tokens.

**Who is Orca?**

* In September 2021, Orca announced a raise of $18M+ from Polychain, Placeholder, and many more. Orca’s mission is to create a next-generation AMM that pairs greater capital efficiency with a simple, human-centered with a simple, human-centered user experience for builders, traders, and LPs alike.
* Over the last month, more than $500M of trading volume was exchanged on Orca. Since its inception, Orca has handled over $30B of trading volume. Orca’s highest daily volume was achieved in April 2022, with close to $450M volume traded.
* Orca is the #1 AMM by trading volume on Solana in the last 6 months, with $15.9B in cumulative trading volume (sources: [Orca Solscan](https://solscan.io/amm/orca), [Whirlpool Solscan](https://solscan.io/amm/whirlpool)).
* Orca is consistently [Jupiter’s #1 pool provider](https://jup.ag/stats/month), accounting for ~35% of their total volume, more than the #2 and #3 AMMs combined.
* Orca currently gathers close to $85M in value locked or, in other words: available liquidity. At its peak (November 2021), Orca’s TVL was close to $1.5B.

“Joining forces with Pyth offers developers in the Solana ecosystem access to the digital data marketplace we all need. It unlocks access to institutional-grade, high-fidelity financial data for any application on any blockchain,” said **Orca’s co-founder Ori Kwan**.

“Orca represents a core piece of infrastructure in the Solana DeFi ecosystem, and the addition of their data to Pyth will enable the network to provide developers with better access to the market price of long-tail assets in the Solana ecosystem,” said **Michael Cahill, Director at the Pyth Data Association**.

We look forward to further joining forces with more amazing partners to build the digital data marketplace we all need — a marketplace for institutional-grade, high-fidelity financial data made accessible for any application on any blockchain.
