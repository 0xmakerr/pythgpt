Norman Wooding, founder and CEO of SCRYPT Digital, said, “Institutional adoption of Digital Assets is well underway, and the same interest is now being geared towards DeFi. This partnership demonstrates the strength of SCRYPT Digital’s institutional offering and resolve in bridging the gap between ‘TradFi’ and ‘DeFi’, with the further advancement of critical DeFi infrastructure having the potential to unlock greater efficiency and transparency in financial systems.
