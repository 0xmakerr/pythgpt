![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*M9pV4irkehPGfmyYSxpvqQ.jpeg)*Following the* [***Pyth network whitepaper***](https://pyth.network/whitepaper) *release and coverage by the* [*Financial Times*](https://www.ft.com/content/b0069c58-bae2-4814-baaf-ab946d4daddb) *on Jan 18, 2022, we wanted to provide the Pythian community a summary:*

Growth in DeFi requires high-fidelity, time-sensitive, real-world data, direct from the source and made available on any L1 blockchain.

Financial market data, however, is often accessible to only a limited set of institutions and users. Traditional markets typically maintain strict control over and access to both live and historical price feeds. Consequently, only a selected group of users has access to the most timely, accurate, and valuable information.

The **Pyth network** is a next-generation oracle solution that aims to bring this valuable financial market data to the general public.

The network does so by incentivizing market participants — trading firms, market makers, and exchanges — to share directly on-chain the price data collected as part of their existing operations. The network then aggregates this first-party price data (on-chain) and makes it available for use by on- or off-chain applications.

End-users (Consumers) of Pyth data can elect to pay data fees to gain protection against a potential oracle failure. Data publishers must stake tokens in order to publish data for a product, and the stake of at-fault publishers (if they make the aggregate price erroneous) will be used as a payout to those end-users voluntarily paying fees.

Delegators choose which product (price feed) and a publisher to stake on top of in order to earn data fees (or lose their stake if the oracle is inaccurate due to publisher faults). Initially, 80% of the data fees will go to delegators while the remaining 20% will be shared among publishers — this, among other parameters, will be subject to change through a PYTH governance.

The design and mechanics around the PYTH utility and governance token aim to make the Pyth network self-sustaining and decentralized.
