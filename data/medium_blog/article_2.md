![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*bZ1dJfLrYfQd0YwBy-RI_g.jpeg)We’re excited to announce that Pyth Price Feeds are now available on [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) zkEVM, a zk-rollup with source code available and providing complete EVM opcode equivalence for a frictionless user experience and the security of Ethereum. Pyth Price Feeds are already empowering applications like [0VIX Protocol](https://twitter.com/0vixProtocol), the first borrow-lending protocol live on the Polygon zkEVM Mainnet.

We look forward to supporting the Polygon DeFi community and helping grow the broader Polygon ecosystem by unlocking once-inaccessible financial data for builders. Developers on Polygon zkEVM can now access [Pyth’s 200+ price feeds](https://pyth.network/price-feeds/) for equities, commodities, foreign exchange pairs, and cryptocurrency! Our integration with Polygon zkEVM is made possible thanks to [Wormhole](https://wormholenetwork.com/) and many leading Polygon contributors.

“*Zero-knowledge based chains are among the most exciting and innovating recent solutions to hit the market, which is one of the reasons why making Pyth data available there is important,”* said Mike Cahill, a Director of the Pyth Data Association. “*We’re excited to continue making Pyth data available everywhere, and specifically the Polygon ecosystem as we continue to equip developers with high-quality data and enable a wide range of new dApps that are powered by Pyth.”*
