MBIT will be providing Pyth with institutional-grade, real-time market data across a wide array of digital asset pairs in support of its mission to bring greater liquidity and transparency to cryptocurrency markets.

“MCAP is such a well-respected trading firm, market maker, and financial technology developer, so it is really exciting to see them get more entrenched in the digital asset ecosystem.

We look forward to further joining forces with more amazing partners to build the digital data marketplace we all need — a marketplace for institutional-grade, high-fidelity financial data made accessible for any application on any blockchain.
