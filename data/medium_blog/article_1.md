![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*VG8sG2cnp_CgeOtUNdcNhA.jpeg)We’re excited to announce that Pyth Price Feeds are now available on the newly launched Ethereum zkEVM: [zkSync Era](https://zksync.io/)! This deployment on zkSync Era was made possible thanks to the amazing contributors at [Matter Labs](https://matter-labs.io/).

We look forward to supporting the zkSync Era community and helping grow the broader DeFi ecosystem by unlocking once inaccessible financial data for builders. Builders on zkSync can now access [Pyth’s 200+ price feeds](https://pyth.network/price-feeds/) for equities, commodities, foreign exchange pairs, and cryptocurrencies! We’re kicking off our launch with [Derivio](https://twitter.com/derivio_xyz), [OT](https://onchain.trade/), and [Nexon Finance](https://www.nexon.finance/)[,](https://increment.finance/) all of who will soon be or are already #PoweredByPyth.

*“Data availability is key to increasing much-needed transparency on chain, and this collaboration with Pyth will enable us to bring the scalability, security, and low fees of zkSync Era to more developers and users worldwide,”* said Marco Cora, Head of Business Development at Matter Labs.

“*Zero-knowledge based chains are among the most exciting and innovating recent solutions to hit the market, which is one of the reasons why making Pyth data available there is important,”* said Mike Cahill, a Director of the Pyth Data Association. “*We’re excited to continue making Pyth data available everywhere, and specifically the zkSync ecosystem as we continue to equip developers with high-quality data and enable a wide range of new dApps that are powered by Pyth.”*
