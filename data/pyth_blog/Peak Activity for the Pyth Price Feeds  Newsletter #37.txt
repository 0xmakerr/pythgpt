Pyth Price Feeds Live on Polygon zkEVMOn par with the public mainnet launch of Polygon zkEVM (made by Vitalik Buterin in person), the Pyth Price Feeds became accessible within mere minutes of its start. Pyth data on Polygon zkEVM is already powering 0VIX Protocol, the first borrow-lending protocol live on mainnet.By integrating with Pyth’s low-latency price feeds, borrow-lending protocols can benefit from Pyth data to increase the loan-to-value of the collateral accepted or leverage Pyth’s confidence intervals to value assets more conservatively.We look forward to supporting the Polygon DeFi community and helping grow the broader Polygon ecosystem by unlocking once-inaccessible financial data for builders.We’re excited to announce that the Pyth Price Feeds are now available on #Polygon #zkEVM 🔮Builders on #Polygon can now permissionlessly request Pyth’s 200+ price feeds for equities, commodities, FX pairs, and cryptocurrencieshttps://t.co/G7k6M13rZz pic.twitter.com/lS01DSGFtX— Pyth Network 🔮 (@PythNetwork) March 27, 2023

Peak Activity for the Pyth Price FeedsIn December 2022, the Pyth network introduced an innovative On-Demand Price Update Model, where users are empowered to “pull” available prices on-chain when needed and enable everyone in that blockchain environment to utilize that updated price.This new oracle design improves on existing oracles in many dimensions. On-demand price updates eliminate the transaction costs paid by the oracle and data providers, which enables it to scale in ways that traditional push oracles cannot. Consequently, the Pyth Price Feeds can and will support frequent price updates for thousands of price feeds across an unlimited number of blockchains.To date, the Pyth on-demand model has already delivered over 600K price updates on-chain to #PoweredByPyth applications across 10 different blockchains.On March 12, the Pyth on-demand model updated close to 25,000 price points on-chain. This weekend was marked by the USDC de-peg (following SVB situation) and the release of 22 perpetual markets on Synthetix Perps.Sending It with Trebuchet NetworkWe are pleased to welcome Trebuchet Network, a cutting-edge analytics firm, to the Pyth network.
