Pyth Network in the Governance Arena  Newsletter #42
What’s New in the Ecosystem?Pyth Launches Price Oracles on MantleIt’s time to don the mantle. We’re pleased to report that Pyth’s low-latency pull oracles are now available on Mantle testnet for developers to try out!Mantle is a high-performance Ethereum Layer 2 network built with modular architecture delivering high security at low fees. The Pyth Network is now supporting exciting upstarts like FusionX and Pinnako Exchange. We look forward to the launch of Mantle on mainnet, and we’ll be ready to support developers with even more price feeds."We are excited to partner with Pyth to bring low-latency, high-quality data to the Mantle Testnet," said Arjun Kalsy, Head of Ecosystem at Mantle. "This collaboration will enable developers to build dApps with access to an ever-growing pool of dynamic data, accelerating innovation in the web3 space."If you’d like to learn more about Mantle and what it means to be #PoweredByPyth, be sure to check out our recent panel discussion with Mantle and FusionX Finance.It’s Governing Time!Governance is paramount for DeFi for two reasons. Firstly, governance allows the community to collectively decide on important matters such as protocol upgrades and the introduction of new features. This democratic approach ensures that decisions are made with the broader interests of the ecosystem in mind. Secondly, governance enhances transparency by providing a platform for open discussions and debates on proposals, enabling stakeholders to voice their opinions and concerns. By allowing stakeholders to actively participate in shaping the protocol's future, governance strengthens the overall resilience and longevity of DeFi ecosystems, making them more decentralized, transparent, and aligned with the user base.You may have seen the Pyth Network appear across topical governance discussions for Aave and Mars Protocol.Aave continues to lead as the borrow-lending protocol for EVM chains. There’s $5B in value locked in Aave currently, with a peak of close to $20B in mid-2021. Given the enormous success of Synthetix’s integration with Pyth for their Perps V2, the contributors of the Pyth Data Association recently submitted a proposal for Aave to adopt Pyth as a backup oracle on Optimism.Following a productive forum discussion, the temperature check for Pyth to Support AAVE on Optimism as a Secondary Oracle has passed with flying colors: 67% for and only 2.5% against.Similarly, Mars Protocol, a money-market built on Osmosis, has kickstarted the governance process to replace its current oracle with Pyth Price Feeds. You can read more about this proposal on their forum post. The proposal suggests to replace their current TWAPs for OSMO, ATOM, USDC, BTC, ETH, and AXL with the Pyth versions.The Pyth Network is also looking forward forward to the decision the Mars token holders will take as the Cosmos Hub ecosystem grows in predominance and the Pythians are ready to fuel Mars’ growth towards the billion dollar TVL milestone.#PoweredByPyth ApplicationsEveryday, new applications are becoming #PoweredByPyth.
