**What is Digital Asset Research?**

* Digital Asset Research (DAR) is a specialized provider of ‘clean’ digital asset data, insights, and research for institutional clients.
* Since 2017, DAR leads by rigorously vetting out noisy inputs for flagship clients such as Bloomberg, FTSE Russell, and Wilshire.
* Each day, DAR processes 200+ million trades to calculate 10,000+ institutional-quality digital asset prices and deliver a range of product solutions to navigate the cryptoverse.

Doug Schwenk, DAR’s CEO, stated, *“As a specialized provider of digital asset data, we’re honored to join Pyth in growing their oracle network and to contribute to the DeFi ecosystem overall. We look forward to furthering their greater mission of delivering reliable, accurate, real-time pricing data to hundreds of applications from lending protocols to derivative platforms.”*

Abhimanyu Bansal, a contributor to the Pyth Data Association, stated, *“DAR is trusted by leading institutions for the quality and depth of their crypto market data. In the same vein, Pyth, as the leading oracle, has been immensely successful in bridging the gap between traditional and decentralized finance. We are confident that our partnership together will promote the growth of and attract new participants to DeFi”*

We look forward to further joining forces with more amazing partners to build the digital data marketplace we all need — a marketplace for institutional-grade, high-fidelity financial data made accessible for any application on any blockchain.
