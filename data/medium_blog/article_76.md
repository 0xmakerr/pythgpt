There is no network like the Pyth network. Pyth is unlocking the best data for equities, commodities, FX, and crypto to empower pioneers across the DeFi space. The **Confidentia** is your weekly tidbit of alpha from these builders — *but that’s a secret between us, OK?*

This week, we’re doing rapid-fire questions with [**Cega**](https://www.cega.fi/), the exotic derivatives protocol.

**Cega** offers safer yields in volatile market environments and recently announced their [mainnet launch](https://twitter.com/cega_fi/status/1539987457772605443) with three inaugural vaults!

*Gotta go fast…!*

**What is Cega?**
-----------------

[**Cega**](https://cega.fi) is the first DeFi exotic derivatives protocol that offers safer, high-yield vaults for investors to stake their stablecoin.

Cega vaults offer principal protection against severe market movements up to a 90% price drop. This means that even if the crypto market falls by 90% in the next 30 days, investors do not lose their principal while still collecting high yield!

We’re bringing real innovation to DeFi and can’t wait to continue growing our catalog of exotic options structured products for investors.

**Pyth x Cega**
---------------

We use Pyth pricing data to determine whether Cega options trades have knocked-in or knocked-out and to to calculate the trade settlement at expiry.

It’s critical that pricing data is accurate, reliable, and available and we count on Pyth to deliver this quality for our customers.

Cega Mainnet and Vaults! Congratulations!
-----------------------------------------

Thank you! We are proud to be building better investment products for crypto retail investors that are safer, high-yielding, and offer yield transparency.

There are **three inaugural vaults** (and a secret fourth vault for Cega NFT holders, more on that later)! Each vault offers different price protection levels, APYs, and exposure to underlying crypto assets so investors can choose the one that aligns best with their needs.

**Vault 1: “Cruise Control”**

* Underlying: BTC-ETH
* Price Protection: 90% protected
* Indicative APY: 8%

**Vault 2: “Genesis Basket”**

* Underlying: BTC-ETH-SOL
* Price Protection: 90% protected
* Indicative APY: 11%

**Vault 3: “Gotta Go Fast”**

* Underlying: BTC-ETH-SOL
* Price Protection: 50% protected
* Indicative APY: 134%

**Get Involved**
----------------

Users who hold our Cega Super Sanics NFT (available on [Magic Eden](https://magiceden.io/marketplace/cega_super_sanics)) in their wallet while browsing our DeFi [web app](https://app.cega.fi/) will see a fourth secret vault offering the highest APY investment opportunity.
