D2X will contribute its first-party crypto price data to the network, adding value to the DeFi community Pyth helps support.

**Who is D2X?**

* D2X plans to be the first institutional-grade and regulated derivatives exchange for digital assets in Europe. Its strong trading interface and capital-efficient risk management will allow institutions to adopt the asset class through cash-settled derivatives.
* D2X was founded in 2020 in Amsterdam with a simple idea: providing financial institutions with capital-efficient and clean exposure to the asset class while mitigating operational and regulatory risks.

D2X’s CEO and Co-Founder Theodore Rozencwajg stated: “D2X is very excited to get involved with Pyth’s game-changing oracle network and become a core data provider for BTC and ETH prices initially. This partnership is a great way to serve our mission to bridge TradFi and the world of digital assets.”

“D2X joins a strong roster of nearly 70 first-party data providers, but their unique position as a regulated derivatives exchange in Europe will make them a terrific addition to the community. We look forward to working alongside them on this growing project.” Commented Stephen Kaminsky, Special Projects at Jump Crypto, one of the leading firms helping to support Pyth.

We look forward to further joining forces with more amazing partners to build the digital data marketplace we all need — a marketplace for institutional-grade, high-fidelity financial data made accessible for any application on any blockchain.
